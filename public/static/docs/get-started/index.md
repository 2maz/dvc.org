# Get Started

_Get Started_ is a step-by-step introduction into basic DVC features. It doesn't
go into details much, but provides links and expandable sections to learn more.

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to run the commands in this guide. Also,
if DVC is not installed, please follow these [instructions](/doc/install) to do
so.

When you're done, feel free to check out official and community
[tutorials](/doc/tutorials). They provide in-depth explanations,
[interactive](/doc/tutorials/interactive) scenarios, and various examples on how
DVC can be used.
