### `dvc.api.open(path, repo=None, rev=None, remote=None, mode="r", encoding=None)`

Opens a tracked file.

```py
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'get-started/data.xml',
        repo='https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry'
        ) as fd:
    # ... fd is a file descriptor that can be processed normally.
```

All **parameter** types are
[string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str).

## Description

Open file or model tracked in a <abbr>DVC projects</abbr> (by DVC or Git), and
return a corresponding
[file object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object). If the
file cannot be found, an `PathMissingError` is raised.

> This function is analogous to the
> [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) Python
> builtin.

It may only be used as a
[context manager](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/#context-managers-in-the-standard-library)
(using the `with` keyword, as shown in the [Examples](#examples) below).

> See also `dvc.api.read()` for a shorthand way to read the complete contents of
> a tracked file â€“ no _context manager_ syntax needed.

`dvc.api.open()` avoids downloading files from **most**
[remote types](/doc/command-reference/remote/add#supported-storage-types). It
returns an open connection to the storage, though which file can be used
directly. Only Google Drive storage does not support this, requiring this
function to completely download the file in `path` (into a temporary directory)
before the file object is made available.

> This has similar uses as the `dvc get` CLI command.

## Parameters

- **`path`** - specifies the location of the target data within the source
  project in `repo`, relative to the project's root.

- `repo` - specifies the location of the source DVC project. If not supplied,
  defaults to the current DVC project. It can be a URL or a file system path.
  Both HTTP and SSH protocols are supported for online Git repos (e.g.
  `[user@]server:project.git`).

  A `dvc.api.UrlNotDvcRepoError` is raised if `repo` is not a valid DVC project.

- `rev` - Git commit (any [revision](https://git-scm.com/docs/revisions) such as
  a branch or tag name, or a commit hash). If not supplied, it uses the default
  Git revision, `HEAD`. If `repo` is a Git repo, this option is ignored.

- `remote` - name of the [DVC remote](/doc/command-reference/remote) to look for
  the target data. If not supplied, the cache directory is tried first for local
  projects; The default remote of `repo` is tried otherwise.

  A `dvc.exceptions.NoRemoteError` is raised if no `remote` is found.

- `mode` - (optional) mirrors the namesake parameter in builtin
  [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open). Defaults to
  `"r"` (read).

- `encoding` - (optional) used to decode contents to a string. Mirrors the
  namesake parameter in builtin `open()`. Defaults to `"utf-8"`.

## Example: Use artifacts from online DVC repositories

Any <abbr>data artifact</abbr> can be employed directly in your Python app by
using this API.

For example, an XML file from a public DVC repo online can be processed directly
in your Python app with:

```py
from xml.dom.minidom import parse

import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'get-started/data.xml',
        repo='https://github.com/iterative/dataset-registry'
        ) as fd:
    xmldom = parse(fd)
    # ... Process DOM
```

> See `dvc.api.read()` for a shorthand way to read the contents of a tracked
> file.

Now let's imagine you want to unserialize and use a binary model from a private
repo online. For a case like this, we can use a SSH URL instead (assuming the
[credentials are configured](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
locally):

```py
import pickle
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'model.pkl',
        repo='git@server.com:path/to/repo.git'
        ) as fd:
    model = pickle.load(fd)
    # ... Use instanciated model
```

## Example: Use a file from the local cache

In this case we don't supply a `repo` argument. DVC will walk up the current
working directory tree to find the <abbr>DVC project</abbr>:

```py
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open('data/nlp/words.txt') as fd:
    for word in fd:
        # ... Process words
```

DVC will look for the file contents of `data/nlp/words.txt` in the local
<abbr>project</abbr>. (If it's not found there, the default
[remote](/doc/command-reference/remote) will be tried.)

To specify the file encoding of a text file:

```py
with dvc.api.open('data/nlp/words.txt', encoding='utf-8') as fd:
    # ...
```

## Example: Use other versions of data or results

The `rev` argument lets you specify any Git commit to look for an artifact. This
way any previous version, or alternative experiment can be accessed
programmatically. For example, let's say your DVC repo has tagged releases of a
CSV dataset:

```py
import csv
import dvc.api

with dvc.api.open(
        'clean.csv',
        rev='v1.1.0'
        ) as fd:
    reader = csv.reader(fd)
    # ... Read clean data from version 1.1.0
```

## Example: Stream file from a specific remote

Sometimes we may want to choose the [remote](/doc/command-reference/remote) data
source, for example to ensure that file streaming is enabled (as not all remote
storage types support streaming). This can be done by providing a `remote`
argument:

```py
import dvc.api

with open(
        'activity.log',
        repo='location/of/dvc/project',
        remote='my-s3-bucket'
        ) as fd:
    for line in fd:
        match = re.search(r'user=(\w+)', line)
        # ...
```
