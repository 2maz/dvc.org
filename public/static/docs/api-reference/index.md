# Python API

When you [install](/doc/install) DVC with an environment manager like `pip` or
`conda`, the `dvc` package becomes available to the corresponding `python`
interpreter. While most of the package implements our
[command-line tool](/doc/command-reference), we wrote the `dvc.api` module to
expose special functions you can use in your Python source code.

> We **strongly** recommend having `dvc` in requirements or setup file for your
> Python project, and installing it via and env manager such as `pip`.

To import the API, use:

```py
import dvc.api
```

This reference provides the details about our API functions, their purpose,
usage, and examples. Please note that they also have inline documentation, which
you can see in the module's
[source code](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/blob/master/dvc/api.py).

> Please don't hesitate in sending a feature request
> [on GitHub](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues) with ideas of other
> functions we could add to the Python API.
