# Python API

DVC can be used as a Python library, simply [install](/doc/install) it with a
package manager like `pip` or `conda`, and as a Python
[project requirement](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
if needed. This reference provides the details about the functions in the API
module `dvc.api`, which can be imported any regular way, for example:

```py
import dvc.api
```

The purpose of our API is to provide programatic access to the data or models
[stored and versioned using DVC](/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files)
from Python apps. Please choose a function from the navigation sidebar to the
left, or click the `Next` button below to jump into the first one â†˜
