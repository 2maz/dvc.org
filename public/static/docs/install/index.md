# Installation

Please double check that you don't already have DVC (for example running
`which dvc`) before trying to install it (again).

- [Install on MacOS](/doc/install/macos)
- [Install on Windows](/doc/install/windows)
- [Install on Linux](/doc/install/linux)

## Install as a Python library

DVC can be used as a Python library, simply install it with a package manager
like `pip` or `conda`, and as a Python
[project requirement](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
if needed. The [Python API](/doc/api-reference) module is `dvc.api`.

## Advanced options

- Shell completion is automatically enabled by certain installation methods. If
  it does not work for you, please see
  [these instructions](/doc/install/completion) to set it up.

- You can [install a stable pre-release](/doc/install/pre-release) of DVC to
  stay ahead of official releases.

- Please also check out these 3rd-party tool [plugins](/doc/install/plugins),
  which might be useful.
