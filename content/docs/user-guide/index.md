# User Guide

Our guides describe the main DVC concepts and features comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use them, as well as connections between them. These
guides don't focus on specific scenarios, but have a general scope – like a
_user manual_. Their topics range from more technical foundations, impacting
more parts of DVC, to more advanced and specific things you can do. We also
include a few guides related to contributing to
[this open-source project](https://github.com/iterative/dvc).

## What is DVC?

Even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning (ML),
specifically deep learning and its applications in business, the data science
community still lacks good practices for organizing their projects and
effectively collaborating across their varied ML projects. This is a critical
challenge: we need to evolve towards ML algorithms and methods no longer being
tribal knowledge and making them easy to implement, reuse, and manage.

To make progress, many areas of the ML experimentation process need to be
formalized. Common questions need to be answered in an unified, principled way.
