# User Guide

Our guides describe the main DVC concepts and features comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use them, as well as connections between them. These
guides don't focus on specific scenarios, but have a general scope – like a
_user manual_. Their topics range from more technical foundations, impacting
more parts of DVC, to more advanced and specific things you can do. We also
include a few guides related to contributing to
[this open-source project](https://github.com/iterative/dvc).

## Why DVC?

Even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning (ML),
specifically deep learning and its applications in business, the data science
community still lacks good practices for organizing their projects and
collaborating effectively. This is a critical challenge: we need to evolve
towards ML algorithms and methods no longer being tribal knowledge and making
them easy to implement, reuse, and manage.

Today the data science community is still lacking good practices for organizing
their projects and effectively collaborating. ML algorithms and methods are no
longer simple tribal knowledge but are still difficult to implement, manage and
reuse.

> One of the biggest challenges in reusing, and hence the managing of ML
> projects, is its reproducibility.
