# User Guide

Our guides describe the major concepts and features of DVC comprehensively,
explaining when and how to use them, as well as relationship between these. We
don't focus on specific scenarios in this section, but rather on a general scope
– think _User Manual_. The topics here range from more foundational, impacting
more parts of DVC, to more technical and advanced things you can do. We also
include a few misc. guides, for example related to
[contributing to DVC](/doc/user-guide/contributing/core) itself.

## Why DVC?

Even with all the success we've seen today in machine learning (ML), especially
with deep learning and its applications in business, the data science community
still lacks good practices for organizing their projects and collaborating
effectively. This is a critical challenge: while ML algorithms and methods are
no longer tribal knowledge, they are still difficult to implement, reuse, and
manage.
