# `.dvc` files

When you add a file or directory with `dvc add`, `dvc import`, or
`dvc import-url`, one or more files ending with the `.dvc` extension ("dot DVC
file") is created to track the target data (e.g. `data.xml.dvc`).

These files use a simple [YAML](https://yaml.org/) scheme that is meant to be
easy to read, edit, or even create. Here is an example:

```yaml
outs:
  - md5: a304afb96060aad90176268345e10355
    path: data.xml
    desc: Cats and dogs dataset

# Comments and user metadata are supported.
meta:
  name: 'John Doe'
  email: john@doe.com
```

## Specification

| Field  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `outs` | (Required) list of [output entries](#output-entries) (details below) that represent the files or directories tracked with DVC. Typically there is only one (but several can be added or combined manually).                   |
| `deps` | List of [dependency entries](#dependency-entries) (details below). Only present when `dvc import` or `dvc import-url` are used to generate this `.dvc` file. Typically there is only one (but several can be added manually). |
| `wdir` | Working directory for the `outs` and `deps` paths (relative to the `.dvc` file's location). It defaults to `.` (the file's location).                                                                                         |
| `md5`  | (Only for <abbr>imports</abbr>) MD5 hash of the `.dvc` file itself.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `meta` | (Optional) arbitrary user metadata can be added manually with this field. Any YAML contents is supported. `meta` contents are ignored by DVC.                                                                                 |

Comments can be entered using the `# comment` format.

> `meta` fields and `#` comments are preserved among executions of `dvc repro`
> and `dvc commit`, but not when the file is overwritten by `dvc add`,
> `dvc move`, `dvc import`, or `dvc import-url`.

| `path`                          | (Required) Path to the file or directory (relative to `wdir`, which defaults to the file's location)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `md5`<br/>`etag`<br/>`checksum` | Hash value for the file or directory being tracked with DVC. MD5 is used for most locations (local file system and SSH); [ETag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag#Strong_and_weak_validation) for HTTP, S3, or Azure [external outputs](/doc/user-guide/managing-external-data); and a special _checksum_ for HDFS and WebHDFS. |
| `size`                          | Size of the file or directory (sum of all files).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `isexec`                        | Whether this is an executable file. DVC preserves execute permissions upon `dvc checkout` and `dvc pull`. This has no effect on directories, or in general on Windows.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `cache`                         | Whether or not this file or directory is <abbr>cached</abbr> (`true` by default).

| `persist`                       | Whether the output file/dir should remain in place while `dvc repro` runs (`false` by default: outputs are deleted when `dvc repro` starts)                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `desc`                          | (Optional) user description for this output (supported in metrics and plots too). This doesn't affect any DVC operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
