# DVC Documentation

Welcome! In here you may find all the material and technical details needed to
learn about DVC: how to use it, how it works, and where to go for additional
resources.

## What is DVC?

Data Version Control, or DVC, is **a new type of experiment management
software** built on top of the existing engineering toolset that you're already
used to, particularly [Git](https://git-scm.com) source code management. DVC
reduces the gap between existing tools and data science needs.

If you store and process data files or datasets to produce other data or machine
learning models, and you want to

- capture and save <abbr>data artifacts</abbr> the same way you capture code;
- track and switch between different versions of data or models easily;
- understand how data or models were built in the first place;
- be able to compare models and metrics to each other;
- bring software engineering best practices to your data science team;
- among other [use cases](/doc/use-cases)

DVC is for you!
