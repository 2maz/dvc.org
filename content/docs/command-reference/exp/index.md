# experiments

‚ö†Ô∏è This feature is only available in DVC 2.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è

A set of commands to generate and manage <abbr>experiment</abbr>:
[run](/doc/command-reference/exp/run), [show](/doc/command-reference/exp/show),
[diff](/doc/command-reference/exp/diff),
[apply](/doc/command-reference/exp/apply),
[branch](/doc/command-reference/exp/branch),
[resume](/doc/command-reference/exp/resume),
[gc](/doc/command-reference/exp/gc), [list](/doc/command-reference/exp/list),
[push](/doc/command-reference/exp/list), and
[pull](/doc/command-reference/exp/pull).

> Aliased to `dvc exp`.

> Requires that Git is being used to version the project.

## Description

`dvc exp` subcommands provide specialized ways to create and manage data science
experiments. The basic workflow goes like this:

- Modify stage <abbr>parameters</abbr> or other dependencies (e.g. input data,
  source code) of committed stages.
- Use `dvc exp run` (instead of `repro`) to execute the pipeline. The results
  are reflected in your <abbr>workspace</abbr>, and tracked automatically.
- Use [metrics](/doc/command-reference/metrics) in your pipeline to identify the
  best experiment(s).
- Visualize and compare experiments with `dvc exp show` or `dvc exp diff`.
  Repeat.
- Use `dvc exp apply` to roll back to the best one.
- Make the selected experiment persistent by committing its results to Git. This
  cleans the slate so you can repeat the process.

üìñ See [Experiment Management](/doc/user-guide/experiment-management) for more
info.

> Note that DVC assumes that <abbr>experiments</abbr> are deterministic (see
> **Avoiding unexpected behavior** in `dvc run`).

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.
