# plot

Contains commands to visualize
[continuous metrics](/doc/command-reference/plot#continuous-metrics) in
structured files (JSON, CSV, or TSV): [show](/doc/command-reference/plot/show),
[diff](/doc/command-reference/plot/diff).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc plot [-h] [-q | -v] {show,diff} ...

positional arguments:
  COMMAND
    show         Generate a plot image file from a continuous metrics file.
    diff         Plot continuous metrics differences between commits in the DVC
                 repository, or between the last commit and the workspace.
```

## Description

DVC provides a set of commands to visualize _continuous metrics_ of machine
learning experiments. Usual examples of plots are AUC curves, loss functions,
and confusion matrices.

Continous metrics represents a plot and should be stored as data series in one
of the supported [file formats](#file-formats). These files are usually created
by users or generated by user's modeling or data processing code.

The plot commands can work with these continuous metrics files that are commited
to a repository history, data files controlled by DVC or files from workspace.
For examlpe, the command `dvc plot diff` generates a plot with two versions of
the metrics:

```dvc
$ dvc plot diff -d logs.csv
file:///Users/dmitry/src/plot/logs.html
```

### Difference between continuous and scolar metrics

DVC has two concepts for metrics for representing result of machine learning
training or data processing:

1. `dvc metrics` to represent scalar numbers such as AUC, true positive rate and
   others.
2. `dvc plot` to visualize continuous metrics such as AUC curve, loss function,
   confusion matrixes and others.

In contrast to continuous metrics, scalar metrics should be stored in a
hirarchical files such as JSON and YAML and `dvc metrics diff` command can
represent difference between the metrics in different experiments as a float
numbers. Like `AUC` metrics is `0.801807` and was increase by `+0.037826` from
the previous value:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics diff
    Path       Metric    Value      Change
summary.json   AUC      0.801807   0.037826
```

### File formats

Supported file formats for continuous metrics are: JSON, CSV, TSV. DVC expects
to see an array (or multiple arrays) of objects (usually _float numbers_) in the
file.

In tabular file formats such as CSV and TSV the array is a column. Plot command
can generate visuals for a specified column or a set of columns. Like `AUC`
column:

```
epoch, AUC, loss
34, 0.91935, 0.0317345
35, 0.91913, 0.0317829
36, 0.92256, 0.0304632
37, 0.92302, 0.0299015
```

In hierarchical file formats such as JSON an array of JSON-objects is expected.
Plot command can generate visuals for a specified field name or a set of fields
from the array's object. Like `val_loss` field in the `train` array in this
example:

```
{
  "train": [
    {"val_accuracy": 0.9665, "val_loss": 0.10757},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.9764, "val_loss": 0.07324},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8770, "val_loss": 0.08136},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8740, "val_loss": 0.09026},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8795, "val_loss": 0.07640},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8803, "val_loss": 0.07608},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8987, "val_loss": 0.08455}
  ]
}
```

### Plot templates

DVC generates plots as HTML files that a user can click and open in a web
browser. The HTML files contain plots as [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/)
objects. The files can also be transformed to traditional PNG, JPEG, SVG image
formats using external tools.

Vega is a declarative, programming language agnostic format of defining plots as
JSON specification. DVC gives users the ability to change the specification and
generate plots in the format that fits the best to the users need. At the same
time, it does not make DVC dependent on user's visualization code or any
programming language or environment which allows DVC stay programming language
agnostic.

Plot templates are stored in `.dvc/plot/` directory as json files. A user can
define it's own templates or modify the existing ones. Please see more details
in `dvc plot show` and `dvc plot diff`.

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

Tabular file `logs.csv` visualization:

```

```

```dvc
$ dvc plot show logs.csv
file:///Users/dmitry/src/plot/logs.html
```

![](/img/plot_show.svg)

Difference between the current file and the previous commited one:

```dvc
$ dvc plot diff -d logs.csv HEAD^
file:///Users/dmitry/src/plot/logs.html
```

![](/img/plot_diff.svg)

Visualize a specific field:

```dvc
$ dvc plot show --field loss logs.csv
file:///Users/dmitry/src/plot/logs.html
```

![](/img/plot_show_field.svg)

Confusion matrix template is predefined in DVC (file
`.dvc/plot/confusion_matrix.json`):

```csv
actual,predicted
cat,cat
cat,cat
cat,cat
cat,dog
cat,dinosaur
cat,dinosaur
cat,bird
turtle,dog
turtle,cat
...
```

```dvc
$ dvc plot show classes.csv --template confusion_matrix

```
