# plot

Contains commands to visualize users data stored in structured files like JSON,
CSV, TSV: [show](/doc/command-reference/plot/show).
[diff](/doc/command-reference/plot/diff).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc plot [-h] [-q | -v] {show,diff} ...
positional arguments:
  {show,diff}    Use `dvc plot CMD --help` to display command-specific help.
    show         Plot data from a file
    diff         Plot changes between commits in the DVC repository,
                 or between the last commit and the workspace.
```

## Description

DVC provides a set of commands to visualize continuous metrics of machine
learning experiments in <abbr>DVC projects</abbr>. These metrics are usually
plotted as AUC curves, loss functions, confusion matrixes and other types of
plots.

The continuous metrics should be saved in files which are usually created by
users or generated by user's modeling or data processing code. The plot commands
can work with these files commited to a repository history, data files
controlled by DVC or files from workspace.

### File formats

Supported file formats for plotting are: JSON, CSV, TSV. DVC expects to see an
array (or multiple arrays) of _float numbers_ in the file.

In tabular file formats such as CSV and TSV the array is a column. Plot command
can generate visuals for a specified column or a set of columns. Like `AUC`
column:

```
epoch, AUC, loss
34, 0.91935, 0.0317345
35, 0.91913, 0.0317829
36, 0.92256, 0.0304632
37, 0.92302, 0.0299015
```

In hierarchical file formats such as JSON an array of JSON-objects is expected.
Plot command can generate visuals for a specified field name or a set of fields
from the array's object. Like `val_loss` field in the `svgtrain` array in this
example:

```
{
  "svgtrain": [
    {"val_accuracy": 0.9665, "val_loss": 0.10757},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.9764, "val_loss": 0.07324},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8770, "val_loss": 0.08136},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8740, "val_loss": 0.09026},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8795, "val_loss": 0.07640},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8803, "val_loss": 0.07608},
    {"val_accuracy": 0.8987, "val_loss": 0.08455}
  ]
}
```

### Visualization engine and plot templates

DVC generates plots as HTML files that a user can click and open in a web
browser. The HTML files contain plots as [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/)
objects. The files can also be transformed to traditional PNG, JPEG, SVG image
formats using external tools.

Vega is a declarative, programming language agnostic format of defining plots as
JSON specification. DVC gives users the ability to change the specification and
generate plots in the format that fits the best to the users need. At the same
time, it does not make DVC dependent on user's visualization code or any
programming language or environment which allows DVC stay programming language
agnostic.

Plot templates are stored in `.dvc/plot/` directory as json files. A user can
define it's own templates or modify the existing ones. Please see more details
in `dvc plot show` and `dvc plot diff`.

### Difference between plots and DVC metrics

DVC has two concepts for metrics for representing result of machine learning
training or data processing:

1. `dvc metrics` to represent scalar numbers such as AUC, true positive rate and
   others.
2. `dvc plot` to visualize continouos metrics such as AUC curve, loss function,
   confusion matrixes and others.

Scalar metrics should be stored in a hirarchical files such as JSON and YAML and
`dvc metrics diff` command can represent difference between the metrics in
different experiments as a float numbers. Like AUC metrics is `0.801807` and was
increase to +0.037826 from the previous value:

```dvc
$ dvc metrics diff
    Path       Metric    Value      Change
summary.json   AUC      0.801807   0.037826
```

Continous metrics should be stored as an array in JSON file or as a column in
CSV or TSV files. Command `dvc plot diff` generates a plot with both of these
metrics:

```dvc
$ dvc plot diff -d logs.csv
file:///Users/dmitry/src/plot/logs.html
```

## Options

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Examples

Tabular file `logs.csv` visualization:
