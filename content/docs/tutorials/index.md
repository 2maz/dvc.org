The material in this section is designed to help new and intermediate users

  basic DVC features. It doesn't go into much detail, but it provides links and
  expandable sections to learn more.

- When you're done, feel free to check out the other official and community
  tutorials that follow. They provide similarly reproducible walkthroughs and
  in-depth explanations on more advanced topics.
