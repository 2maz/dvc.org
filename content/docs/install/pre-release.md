# Install Pre-release Version

If you want to test the latest stable version of DVC, ahead of official
releases, you can install it from our code repository GitHub.

> We **strongly** recommend creating a
> [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)
> or using
> [pipx](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/)
> (on Python 3.6+) to encapsulate your local environment.

```dvc
$ pip install --upgrade --pre dvc
```

To install a development version for contributing to the project, please refer
