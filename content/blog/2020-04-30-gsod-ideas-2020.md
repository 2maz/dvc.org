Exciting announcement! After a successful experience with
[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) 2019,
we're putting out a call for writers to apply to work with DVC as part of the
[2020 edition](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). If you want to get
involved with open source software documentation with mentorship from our team,
read on.

## Prerequisites to apply

Besides the general requirements to apply to Google Season of Docs, there are a
few skills we look for in applicants.

1. **Clear English writing.** We strive express the concepts, processes, and
   details around DVC clearly, correctly, and completely. We use general and
   friendly wording as much as possible and pay close attention to consistency
   in our terminology.

1. **Command line experience.** [DVC](/doc/home) is a command line tool that
   builds on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), so being able to play with it
   and test the features will be very useful. Creating and managing files,
   GNU/Linux commands, file and permission admin are desired skills.

1. **People skills.** We put a high value on communication: the ability to
   discuss ideas, explain your goals, report progress, and work kindly with more
   or less technical teammates.

If you like our mission but aren't sure if you're sufficiently prepared, please
be in touch anyway. We'd love to hear from you.

## Project ideas

Below are several project ideas that are an immediate priority for the DVC docs
team. We welcome writers to create their own proposals, even if they differ from
our ideas. Projects will be primarily mentored by our lead technical writer,
[Jorge](https://github.com/jorgeorpinel).

1. **How-to section.** We have compiles a
   [set of topics](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/899) that we
   think would be best explained in a new "How to" section of our docs. This
   will imply relocating bits and pieces of info from existing docs into new
   how-tos, as well as writing significant new material to complete them.

   _Difficulty rating:_ Beginner-Medium<br/><br/>

1. **Tutorials to Blog.** DVC is currently rewriting it's main tutorial, the
   [Get Started](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/pull/1074). The remaining
   [Tutorials](https://dvc.org/doc/tutorials) will then become somewhat
   redundant so we are considering moving them out of the docs and into blog
   posts instead. Other possible rearrangements of the tutorials may end up
   being preferred.

   _Difficulty rating:_ Medium-Advanced<br/><br/>

1. **Integrate interactive guides.** We have a set of
   [Katacoda scenarios](https://www.katacoda.com/dvc) to match different
   sections of our docs. These need to be checked and updated, as well as
   embedded into the corresponding pages per
   [this issue](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues/670). This would
   involve working with our front-end team or, preferably, having some
   Javascript coding experience.

   _Difficulty rating:_ Advanced

> For more inspiration, feel free to review our open
> [documentation issues](https://github.com/iterative/dvc.org/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adoc-content+).
