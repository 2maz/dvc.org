Exciting announcement! After a successful experience with
[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) 2019,
we're putting out a call for writers to apply to work with DVC as part of the
[2020 edition](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). If you want to get
involved with open source software documentation with mentorship from our team,
read on.

## Prerequisites to apply

Besides the general requirements to apply to Google Season of Docs, there are a
few skills we look for in applicants.

1. **Clear English writing.** We strive express the concepts, processes, and
   details around DVC clearly, correctly, and completely. We use general and
   friendly wording as much as possible and pay close attention to consistency
   in our terminology.

1. **Command line experience.** [DVC](/doc/home) is a command line tool that
   builds on top of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), so being able to play with it
   and test the features will be very useful. Creating and managing files,
   GNU/Linux commands, file and permission admin are desired skills.

1. **People skills.** We put a high value on communication: the ability to
   discuss ideas, explain your goals, report progress, and work kindly with more
   or less technical teammates.

If you like our mission but aren't sure if you're sufficiently prepared, please
be in touch anyway. We'd love to hear from you.

## Project ideas

Below are several project ideas that are an immediate priority for the DVC docs
team. We welcome writers to create their own proposals, even if they differ from
our ideas. Projects will be primarily mentored by our lead technical writer,
[Jorge](https://github.com/jorgeorpinel).

1. **How-to section.** Foo.

   _Skills required:_ Python, Git, experience with APIs <br/> _Difficulty
   rating:_ Beginner-Medium<br/><br/>

1. **Tutorials -> Blog.** Bar.

   _Skills required:_ Python, Git. Some experience with parallelization and/or
   scientific computing would be helpful but not required. <br/> _Difficulty
   rating:_ Advanced<br/><br/>

   experience <br/> _Difficulty rating:_ Beginner-Medium
