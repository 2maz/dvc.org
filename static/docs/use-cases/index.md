# Use Cases

We provide common DVC scenarios in this section, with examples that combine
several features and commands in DVC. These range from basic (like data and
model [file versioning](/doc/use-cases/data-and-model-files-versioning)) to more
advanced (such as optimizing resources on a
[single development machine](/doc/use-cases/multiple-data-scientists-on-a-single-machine)).

This list is _not_ exhaustive. We keep reviewing it and try to include
interesting scenarios that surface in our community. Please,
[contact us](/support) if you need help or have suggestions!

Use cases are not written to be run end-to-end. For more general hands-on
experience with DVC, we recommend to follow the [Get Started](/doc/get-started),
and/or [Tutorial](/doc/tutorial)] first, which include prepared datasets, source
code files, and example commands that can be copied and pasted into terminal.
