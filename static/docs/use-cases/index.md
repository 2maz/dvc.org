# Use Cases

We provide short articles on common ML workflow or data management scenarios
that DVC can help with or improve. These include a justified context (usually
extracted from real-life cases), and the approaches to solving them combine
several features and commands of DVC, as well as other appropriate tools. They
range from basic to more advanced:

- [Data Versioning](/doc/use-cases/data-and-model-files-versioning) describes
  our most primary use: tracking and versioning large files with Git + DVC.
- [Share Data and Model Files](/doc/use-cases/share-data-and-model-files) goes
  over basic collaboration possibilities enabled by DVC.
- [Shared Development Server](/doc/use-cases/shared-development-server.md)
  describes a single development machine setup for teams that prefer so.

This list of use cases is _not_ exhaustive. We keep reviewing our docs and will
include interesting scenarios that surface in our community. Please,
[contact us](/support) if you need help or have suggestions!

Use cases are not written to be run end-to-end. For more general hands-on
experience with DVC, we recommend to follow the [Get Started](/doc/get-started),
and/or [Tutorial](/doc/tutorial)] first – which include prepared datasets,
source code files, and example commands that can be copied and pasted into
terminal. These articles also link to our more general
[User Guide](/doc/user-guide), and technical
[command references](/doc/command-reference).
