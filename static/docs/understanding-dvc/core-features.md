# Core Features

- DVC works **on top of Git repositories** and has a similar command line
  interface and Git workflow.

- It makes data science projects **reproducible** by creating lightweight
  [pipelines](/doc/command-reference/pipeline) using implicit dependency graphs.

- **Large data file versioning** works by creating pointers in your Git
  repository to the <abbr>cache</abbr>, typically stored on a local hard drive.

- **Programming language agnostic**: Python, R, Julia, shell scripts, etc. ML
  library agnostic: Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, scipy, etc.

- **Open-sourced** and **Self-served**: DVC is free and doesn't require any
  additional services.

- DVC supports cloud storage (Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud
  Storage) for **data sources and pre-trained models sharing**.
