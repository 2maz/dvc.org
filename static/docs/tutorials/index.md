# DVC Basic Concepts and Features

Learn basic concepts and features of DVC with interactive lessons:

1. [Data Management](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/data) <br/> The
   core function of DVC is data tracking and management. Let's see how to do it.

2. [Getting the Best Performance](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/performance)
   <br/> It is important to optimize the DVC setup for having the best
   performance with handling big data files.

3. [Tracking Data Versions](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/versioning)
   <br/> DVC takes advantage of GIT's versioning features to keep track of the
   data versions.

4. [Sharing Data](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/sharing) <br/> DVC
   facilitates sharing of data between different people that work on the same
   project.

5. [Stages And Pipelines](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/basics/pipelines)
   <br/> DVC has a built-in way to connect ML steps into a DAG and run the full
   pipeline end-to-end.

# Interactive Tutorials

1. [Data Versioning](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/versioning)
   <br/> Using DVC commands to work with multiple versions of datasets and ML
   models.

2. [Pipelines](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/pipelines) <br/> Using
   DVC commands to build a simple ML pipeline.

3. [dvc fetch](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/examples) <br/> We will use an
   example project with some data, code, ML models, pipeline stages, as well as
   a few Git tags. Then we will see what happens with dvc fetch as we switch
   from tag to tag.
