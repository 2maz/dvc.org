# Interactive Tutorials

Learn how DVC can be used in simple ML scenarios:

1. [Data Versioning](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/versioning)
   <br/> Using DVC commands to work with multiple versions of datasets and ML
   models.

2. [Stages and Pipelines](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/tutorials/pipelines)
   <br/> Using DVC commands to build a simple ML pipeline.

3. [dvc fetch](https://katacoda.com/dvc/courses/examples) <br/> We will use an
   example project with some data, code, ML models, pipeline stages, as well as
   a few Git tags. Then we will see what happens with dvc fetch as we switch
   from tag to tag.
