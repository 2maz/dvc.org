# Installation

Please double check that you don't already have DVC (for example running
`which dvc`) before trying to install it (again).

- [Install on Mac OS](/doc/install/macos)
- [Install on Windows](/doc/install/windows)
- [Install on Linux](/doc/install/linux)

## Advanced options

- Shell completion is included with certain installation methods
  ([Debian/UbuntuFedora/CentOS Linux repositories](/doc/install/linux#install-from-repository)
  and [MacOS Homebrew](/doc/install/macos#install-with-brew)), and it can be
  easily [setup manually](/doc/install/completion) for most others.

- You can [install a stable pre-release](/doc/install/pre-release) of DVC to
  stay ahead of official releases.

- Please also check out these 3rd-party tool
  [plugins](/doc/user-guide/install/plugins), which might be useful.
