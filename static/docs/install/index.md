# Installation

Please double check that you don't already have DVC (for example running
`which dvc`) before trying to install it (again).

- [Install on Mac OS](/doc/install/macos)
- [Install on Windows](/doc/install/windows)
- [Install on Linux](/doc/install/linux)

You can also [install the development version](/doc/install/pre-release), before
the official release.

It is recommended to setup [shell completion](/doc/install/completion) as well.
And check out these [plugins](/doc/install/plugins), which might be useful too.
