# Installation

Please double check that you don't already have DVC (for example running
`which dvc`) before trying to install it (again).

- [Install on Mac OS](/doc/install/macos)
- [Install on Windows](/doc/install/windows)
- [Install on Linux](/doc/install/linux)

You can also [install a pre-release](/doc/install/pre-release) to stay ahead of
official releases.

It's recommended to setup [shell completion](/doc/user-guide/install/completion)
as well. And check out these [plugins](/doc/user-guide/install/plugins), which
might be useful too.
