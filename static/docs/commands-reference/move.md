# move

Renames an output file and modifies the stage file (i.e, the one ending with .dvc) to reflect the change. If the output has the same name as its stage, it would also rename the corresponding stage file.

```
        e.g.
              Having: (hello, hello.dvc)

              $ dvc move hello greetings

              Result: (greeting, hello.dvc)
	      
```
with the **path** in hello.dcv changed to **greetings**:

```text
md5: 3d1a3e5a5b662490e198d6a6ae84984b
outs:
- cache: true
  md5: c8263e8422925b0872ee1fb7c953742a
  path: greetings
```


It only works with files generated by `add` or `import`, also known as **data sources**.

 

## Synopsis

```text 
    usage: dvc move [-h] [-q] [-v] src dst

    positional arguments:
        src                   Source
        dst                   Destination
   
```

## Options

 *  `-h, --help`            show help message and exit
 *  `-q, --quiet`           show no output messages at all
 *  `-v, --verbose`         verbose shows all the details of what is happening including the SQL commands sent to the remote repository

## Details


Let's imagine the following scenario:

```
dvc add data.csv
```

The **add** command would create a **data.csv.dvc** file with the following content:

```text
md5: 3d1a3e5a5b662490e198d6a6ae84984b
outs:
- cache: true
  md5: c8263e8422925b0872ee1fb7c953742a
  path: data.csv
```

If we move this using the regular Linux `mv data.csv other.csv` the stage file wouldn't know that we changed the **path** of **data.csv** to **other.csv**.  

So, we introduced `dvc move` to adjust the content of the stage file to update **path**.  So that saves some manual and programming steps.

To illustrate:

```text
dvc move data.csv other.csv

cat data.csv.dvc
md5: 3d1a3e5a5b662490e198d6a6ae84984b
outs:
- cache: true
  md5: c8263e8422925b0872ee1fb7c953742a
  path: other.csv


```


## Examples
Here we use `dvc add`to put a file under DVC control.  Then we change the name of it using `dvc move`.

```text

  $ dvc add data.csv
     
     Adding 'data.csv' to '.gitignore'.
     Saving 'data.csv' to cache '.dvc/cache'.
     Saving information to 'data.csv.dvc'.

To track the changes with git run:
     git add .gitignore data.csv.dvc
     
   $ dvc move data.csv data.csv.moved
     
     Output 'data.csv.moved' didn't change. Skipping saving.
     Adding 'data.csv.moved' to '.gitignore'.
     Saving information to 'data.csv.dvc'.

To track the changes with git run:

	git add .gitignore .gitignore data.csv.dvc  
```
