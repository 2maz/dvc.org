# get

Download or copy file or directory from another DVC repository (on a Git server
e.g. Github) into the local file system.

> Unlike `dvc import`, this command does not track the downloaded data files
> (does not create a DVC-file).

## Synopsis

```usage
usage: dvc get [-h] [-q | -v] [-o [OUT]] [--rev [REV]] url path

positional arguments:
  url         URL of Git repository with DVC project to download from.
  path        Path to data within DVC repository.
```

## Description

DVC provides an easy way to reuse datasets, intermediate results, ML models, or
other files and directories tracked in another DVC repository into the current
working directory, regardless of whether it's a DVC project. The `dvc get`
command downloads such a <abbr>data artifact</abbr>.

The `url` argument specifies the address of the Git repository containing the
external <abbr>DVC project</abbr> (both HTTP and SSH protocols supported, e.g.
`[user@]server:project.git`). `path` is used to specify the path of the data to
be downloaded within the repo.

Note that this command doesn't require an existing DVC project to run in. It's a
single-purpose command that can be used out of the box after installing DVC.

> See `dvc get-url` to download data from other supported URLs.

After running this command successfully, the data found in the `url` `path` is
created in the current working directory, with its original file name.

## Options

- `-o`, `--out` - specify a path (directory and file name) to the desired
  location to place the imported data in. The default value (when this option
  isn't used) is the current working directory (`.`) and original file name.

- `--rev` - specific Git revision of the DVC repository to import the data from.
  The tip of the default branch is used by default when this option is not
  specified.

- `-h`, `--help` - prints the usage/help message, and exit.

- `-q`, `--quiet` - do not write anything to standard output. Exit with 0 if no
  problems arise, otherwise 1.

- `-v`, `--verbose` - displays detailed tracing information.

## Example: Machine learning model deployment

> Note that `dvc get` can be used from anywhere in the file system, as long as
> DVC is [installed](/doc/get-started/install).

We can use `dvc get` to download the resulting model file from our
[get started example repo](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started),
which is a DVC repository external to the current working directory). The
desired file is tracked in the root of the external <abbr>project</abbr>, and
named `model.pkl`.

```dvc
$ dvc get https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started model.pkl
Preparing to download data from 'https://remote.dvc.org/get-started'
...
$ ls
model.pkl
```

Note that the `model.pkl` file doesn't actually exist in the
[root directory](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started/tree/master/)
of the external Git repository. Instead, the corresponding DVC-file
[train.dvc](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started/blob/master/train.dvc)
is found, which specifies `model.pkl` in its outputs (`outs`). DVC then
[pulls](/doc/commands-reference/pull) the file from the default
[remote](/doc/commands-reference/remote) of the external DVC project (found in
its
[config file](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started/blob/master/.dvc/config)).

A recommended use for downloading binary files from DVC repositories, as done in
this example, is to place a ML model inside a wrapper application that serves as
an [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) pipeline or as
an HTTP/RESTful API (web service) that provides predictions upon request. This
can be automated leveraging DVC with
[CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) tools.

The same example applies to raw or intermediate data files as well, of course,
for cases where we want to download those files and perform some analysis on
them.

## Example: Compare different versions of the same experiment

`dvc get` has the `--rev` option, to specify which version of the repository to
download a <abbr>data artifact</abbr> from. It also has the `--out` option to
specify the file or directory path and file name for the download. Combining
these two options allows us to do something we can't achieve with the regular
`git checkout` + `dvc checkout` process â€“ see for example the
[Get Older Data Version](/doc/get-started/older-versions) chapter of our _Get
Started_ section.

Let's use the
[get started example repo](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started)
again, like in the previous example. But this time, clone it first to see
`dvc get` in action inside a <abbr>DVC project</abbr>.

```dvc
$ git clone git@github.com:iterative/example-get-started.git
$ cd example-get-started
```

If you are familiar with our [Get Started](/doc/get-started) example, you may
know that each chapter has a corresponding
[tag](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started/tags). Tag `7-train` is
where we train a first version of the example model, and tag `9-bigrams-model`
has an improved model (trained using bigrams). What if we wanted to have both
versions of the model "checked out" at the same time? `dvc get` provides an easy
way to do this:

```dvc
$ dvc get . model.pkl --rev 7-train --out model.monograms.pkl
```

> Notice that the `url` provided to `dvc get` above is `.`. `dvc get` accepts
> file system paths as a "URL" to the repository to get the data from for edge
> cases.

The `model.monograms.pkl` file now contains the older version of the model. To
get the most recent one, we use a similar command, but with

`-o model.bigrams.pkl` and `--rev 9-bigrams-model` or even without `--rev`
(since it's the latest version anyway). In fact in this case using `dvc pull`
should suffice, downloading the file as just `model.pkl`, which we can then
rename to make it extra obvious:

```dvc
$ dvc pull train.dvc
$ mv model.pkl model.bigrams.pkl
```

And that's it! Now we have both model files in the <abbr>workspace</abbr>, with
different names, and not currently tracked by Git:

```dvc
$ git status
...
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	model.bigrams.pkl
	model.monograms.pkl
```
