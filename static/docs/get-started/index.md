# Get Started

Get started is a step by step intoduction into basic DVC concepts. It does not 
go into detais much, but provides links and expandable sections to learn more.
It's made to be runnable and you should be able to create a simple DVC project
from scratch, but there is also a prepared
[Github repository](https://github.com/iterative/example-get-started) that has
the final and all the intermediate steps in it (we are using git tags as
markers).

At the very end there are a few complete step-by-step examples to give you
more hands-on experience with real-life scenarios - first is about model and
data set [versioning](/doc/get-started/example-versioning), and the second one
is focused on [pipelines](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline) and
reproducibility.
