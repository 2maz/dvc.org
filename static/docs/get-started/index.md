# Get Started

In the next few chapters you can learn how to install DVC, do basic

feel for DVC.

At the very end there are a few complete step-by-step **examples** to give you
more hands-on experience with real life scenarios - model and data set
[versioning](/doc/get-started/example-versioning), build
[pipelines](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline) and reproducibility.
