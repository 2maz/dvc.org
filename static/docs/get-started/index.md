# Get Started

In the next few chapters you can learn how to install DVC, do basic configuration,
and use basic features. Following along should be enough to get a feel for DVC.

At the very end there is a complete step-by-step
[example](/doc/get-started/example). It covers pipelines and reproducibility.
It's a short version of the [tutorial](/doc/tutorial).

Check out the [Github](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) page and give us a ‚≠ê if
you like the project!

We also have other short tutorials to describe different use cases:

* In the [data and model versioning](/doc/use-cases/data-and-model-files-versioning)
you can learn how to use DVC to take under control large data or model files.

* In the [share data and model files](/doc/use-cases/share-data-and-model-files)
a basic collaboration workflow for the data science team is described. You can
learn how to move efficiently and consistently data files and models between
different environments and people.
