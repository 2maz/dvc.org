# Get Started

In the next few chapters, you can learn how to install DVC, do basic
configuration, and use basic features. Following along should be enough to get a
feel for DVC.

At the very end there are a few complete step-by-step examples to give you
more hands-on experience with real-life scenarios - first is about model and
data set [versioning](/doc/get-started/example-versioning), and the second one
is focused on [pipelines](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline) and
reproducibility.
