# Get Started

In the next few chapters you can learn how to install DVC, do basic
configuration, and use basic features. Following along should be enough to get a
feel for DVC.

At the very end there are a few complete step-by-step examples to give you more
hands-on experience with real life scenarios - model and data set
[versioning](/doc/get-started/example-versioning), build
[pipelines](/doc/get-started/example-pipeline) and reproducibility.

✅ We also have other short tutorials to describe different use cases:

* In the [data and model versioning](/doc/use-cases/data-and-model-files-versioning)
you can learn how to use DVC to take under control large data or model files.

* In the [share data and model files](/doc/use-cases/share-data-and-model-files)
a basic collaboration workflow for the data science team is described. You can
learn how to move efficiently and consistently data files and models between
different environments and people.
