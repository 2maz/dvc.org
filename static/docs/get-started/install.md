# Install

There are three ways to install DVC: `pip`, OS package, and Homebrew (depending
on your OS some of these ways may be not available for you).

The simplest way to install DVC is:

```dvc
    $ pip install dvc
```

If you have troubles installing it with `pip`, self-contained binary packages
are provided, use Download button to the left or get them
[here](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/releases/).

See [Development](/doc/user-guide/development) if you want to install the most
recent development version.

### Homebrew

Mac OS users can also install DVC by using either **brew formula** or
**brew cask**:

```dvc
    $ brew install iterative/homebrew-dvc/dvc
```

or:

```dvc
    $ brew cask install iterative/homebrew-dvc/dvc
```
