# Installation

Please double check that you don't already have DVC (for example running
`which dvc`) before trying to install it (again).

- [Install on Mac OS](/doc/user-guide/install/macos)
- [Install on Windows](/doc/user-guide/install/windows)
- Install on Linux
  - [Install on Debian and Ubuntu](/doc/user-guide/install/linux/debian)
  - [Install on Fedora and CentOS](/doc/user-guide/install/linux/fedora)

You can also
[install the latest version of code](/doc/user-guide/install/extra/code), before
the official release.

It is recommended to setup
[shell completion](/doc/user-guide/install/completion) as well. And check out
these [plugins](/doc/user-guide/install/plugins), which might be useful too.
