# Installation on Arch Linux

## Install with pip

```dvc
$ pip install dvc
```

Depending on the type of the
[remote storage](/doc/user-guide/external-dependencies) you plan to use, you
might need to install optional dependencies: `[s3]`, `[ssh]`, `[gs]`, `[azure]`,
and `[oss]`. Use `[all]` to include them all.

### Example: How to install DVC with support for Amazon S3 storage

```dvc
$ pip install 'dvc[s3]'
```

In this case it installs `boto3` library as well, besides DVC.

```
