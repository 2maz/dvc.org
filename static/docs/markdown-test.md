# Live demo

Changes are automatically rendered as you type.

* Implements [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
* Renders actual, "native" React DOM elements
* Allows you to escape or skip HTML (try toggling the checkboxes above)
* If you escape or skip the HTML, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used! Yay!

## Some commands

```sh
$ dvc add image.gz
$ dvc.run
$ dvc push
```

## How about some code?
```js
var React = require('react');
var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

React.render(
  <Markdown source="# Your markdown here" />,
  document.getElementById('content')
);
```

Pretty neat, eh?

## Python code example
```python
# Import the modules
import sys
import random

ans = True

while ans:
    question = raw_input("Ask the magic 8 ball a question: (press enter to quit) ")
    
    answers = random.randint(1,8)
    
    if question == "":
        sys.exit()
    
    elif answers == 1:
        print "It is certain"
    
    elif answers == 2:
        print "Outlook good"
    
    elif answers == 3:
        print "You may rely on it"
    
    elif answers == 4:
        print "Ask again later"
    
    elif answers == 5:
        print "Concentrate and ask again"
    
    elif answers == 6:
        print "Reply hazy, try again"
    
    elif answers == 7:
        print "My reply is no"
    
    elif answers == 8:
        print "My sources say no"
```
