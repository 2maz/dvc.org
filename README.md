[DVC](https://github.com/iterative/dvc) project documenation and website source
code.

# Documentation

Documentation engine was built using React, react Markdown library, Algolia to
aprovide full text search. Motivation for bulding it from scratch was lack of
flexibility (customization, sidebar tuning) and ads in engines like
readthedocs, docsify, etc.

Please, feel free to use it for your own sites and reach us out if you have
any questions.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see our
[Contributing Guide](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/contributing/) for more
details. 

If you want to change a specific documenation page, please use 
**Edit on Github** button (at the top of the page).

To add a new chapter. Create a Markdown file at the right place in the
`static\docs` directory and edit `src/Documentation/sidebar.json` files to
include that file.
